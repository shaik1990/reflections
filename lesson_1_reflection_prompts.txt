What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros--> manually choosing to commit is better, if not the files are public on the repo and they are not ready
    cons--> if there is interlink between two files then it would be a problem for automatically saved, coz the other interlinked file will not 	    show up in the commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Comment: git saves all the history, all the versions of files edited.
    

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
